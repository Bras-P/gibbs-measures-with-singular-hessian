# Convergence rates of Gibbs measures with degenerate minimum
[arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11557v2), [Bernoulli Journal link](https://www.e-publications.org/ims/submission/BEJ/user/submissionFile/49843?confirm=55a2fac1)

This repository contains a notebook showing how we can compute the higher order nested expansion of some objective function to be minimized in problems where the Hessian matrix at the minimum is singular. In this example, we train a neural network and study the behaviour of the loss function in the neighbourhood of the (empirical) minimum.

The machine learning library that is used is TensorFlow.
